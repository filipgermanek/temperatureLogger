## 1.Introduction
This is a project for temperature logging and publishing the results to Adafruit feed. The way it works is that we have a DHT11 temperature sensor connected to Wemos board. The sensor measures temperature and publishes the results to the specified Adafruit feed. 

## 2.Assembly
Materials: Wemos board, DHT11 sensor, Micro USB cable
Wiring: You need to connect three wires from the wemos board to the DHT11 sensor. Connect 5v to v5, Di to D2 on the board and G to G.
